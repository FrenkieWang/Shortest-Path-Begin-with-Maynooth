# Shortest-Path-Begin-with-Maynooth
This project is to use "Greedy Algorithm" to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP), and show them on the Map.

I used "ReadFiledata" to read all the data from a txt file line by line.
I used "split" method to get the latitude and longitude of each school.
I used "Great-circle distance" to calculate the distance between two GPS coordinates.

I used "Greedy Algorithm" to solve TSP problem.
I used "MyCanvas" to set the Map as background and draw the circle and line.

Please change the file address at Line 35.
The file is "120schools.txt" which stores the coordinates location of 120 schools.

Please change the image address at Line 198.
